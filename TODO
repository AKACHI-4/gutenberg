- include progress bar/waiting visual system during json_data loading
- remember topmenu visibility over reloads
- Better handling of failed downloads and mirrors

WONTFIX:
- manage the case where a book has multiple language (e.g. 10 books for French): not possible automatically because sometimes there are multiple files one-per-language (e.g. 1000 some in French and some in English even if only French is written in the metadata), sometimes the multiple languages written in the metadata are for books with mixed languages (e.g. 14568 in Middle English enm and English en); even if it should be better to manage these cases, the various cases must be carefully studied and sorted, and probably the books should be manually sorted, or equivalently the metadata should be improved
