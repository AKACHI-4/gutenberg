- manage the case where a book has multiple language (e.g. 10 books for French)
- popularity sort button should "active" per default
- check the 2753 which has a strange DB entry -- Seb: there should not be a problem, correct on my computer, to be checked after a new parsing
- Change Home lang input to a select with 2 optgroups: main (sorted by pop) and others (sorted alphabetically). Both have nb of books inside.
- check list authors for export json (too much ?)
